  - rscdel: "Deleted a cable that mistakenly hotwired the command subgrid to mains"
  - rscdel: "Deleted a mistakenly placed dorms sort junction placed near the bridge in the walls"
  - bugfix: "Fixed some missing atmos pipes on deck 3"
  - bugfix: "Fixed a disposal junction facing the wrong way in the outpost reactor area"
  - bugfix: "Fixed the port solars - They now have cable coils placed underneath and work again"
  - bugfix: "Fixed a broken airlock on deck 0"
  - bugfix: "Fixed a broken airlock on the trading ship shelter capsule"
  - bugfix: "Fixed two sorting junctions having incorrect sorting tags, causing items to be missing from the tagger list and causing the CMO tag to be broken"

  - maptweak: "Changed the wall on deck 0 big bedroom to be false as originally intended"
  - maptweak: "Removed the hallway area status from plating outside deck 1 escape pods to prevent vines and mucous from spawning there"
  - maptweak: "Tweaked the Fore-Starboard solars to be matching and more in line with the other new solar arrays, minus the start of shift wiring of course"

  - maptweak: "Added plating the gaps on the solar arrays so the gaps don't get filled with power wasting shields"

  - maptweak: "Extended the viro disposal chute and ended it with an outlet and a diffuser - to stop shields from blocking the disposal, and to control its direction of exit."
